# Movee App with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile

This is a **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) Project** that demonstrates code sharing between iOS and Android apps. It includes iOS and Android applications with a native UI and a module with networking code shared between both platforms.

## How to use

With the [KMM plugin for Android Studio](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile) you can run, test, and debug shared code on both platforms without switching IDEs. Run and debug the application by selecting the corresponding configuration in the **Run configuration** menu. Run and debug shared module tests by pressing the gutter icon on a test class or method.
